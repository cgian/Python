# Python Repository

## Overview
This repository contains various Python projects and activities. It is divided into two main subfolders:
- **Python Projects**: Includes a collection of independent coding projects that focus on solving practical problems.
- **Python Activities**: Smaller exercises that practice fundamental concepts in Python.

### Python Projects:
- **Binary Search**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm to efficiently find elements in a sorted array.
- **Data Scraping (Largest US Companies)**: A Python script that scrapes data about the largest companies in the US from a website, saving it into a CSV for analysis.
- **Email Sender**: Sends emails to one or multiple recipients using Python’s `smtplib`. Handles email formatting and batch processing.
- **Large File Renamer 1**: Renames files in a directory by sorting them in the correct numeric order (1, 2, 3...) rather than alphabetically.
- **Large File Renamer 2**: Adds zero padding to file names in a folder based on the total number of digits in the sequence, ensuring correct alphabetical sorting.
- **Rock Paper Scissors Game**: A Python game where the player can compete against the computer in Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- **Zodiac Sign Finder**: A Python script that takes a person’s birthdate and returns their zodiac sign, storing data in a CSV.

### Python Activities:
- Exercises that explore basic Python concepts, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
